# 🌌 3D Solar System Simulation using Three.js

This project is an interactive 3D simulation of the Solar System, built using the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) WebGL library. It visually represents the orbits and rotations of the planets around the Sun, enhanced with user controls and modern UI features.
